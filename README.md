# **Inventory Management Version Control with S3 Versioning**

## **Domain**: Logistics & Supply Chain

### **Problem Statement**
Logistics companies face challenges in managing real-time inventory changes. Without version control, inventory data may become inconsistent or inaccurate, leading to poor decision-making, discrepancies, and operational inefficiencies.

### **Challenges**
- **Inconsistent or Incorrect Inventory Records**: Without a proper versioning system, keeping track of inventory changes is difficult, resulting in inaccurate records.
- **Difficulty Tracking Inventory Changes**: Real-time updates and modifications may go unnoticed, leading to potential stock discrepancies.
- **Limited Traceability**: The lack of traceability makes it hard to understand when or why an inventory change occurred.

### **Solution Overview**
By using **S3 Versioning**, we can store and track all changes to inventory records, ensuring that every update is preserved and accessible for auditing and historical review. Versioning offers an easy way to trace, roll back, or compare changes in inventory records.

### **How It Solves the Problem**
By storing inventory records in a versioned S3 bucket, we can ensure that every update is tracked, providing full visibility into the history of changes. This helps maintain data integrity and allows rollback to previous inventory states when needed.

## **How We Will Solve the Problems**

1. **Enable S3 Versioning for Inventory Data**: Store all inventory records in an S3 bucket with versioning enabled, ensuring every change creates a new version.
2. **Build an Interface for Version Comparison**: Provide tools for logistics managers to view and compare changes in inventory data, ensuring accurate and consistent records.
3. **Audit and Traceability**: Maintain a full history of inventory changes, making it easier to audit and review any adjustments made.

## **Features**
- **Version Control for Inventory Records**: Automatically track and store inventory records as new versions with every change.
- **Traceability**: The versioning system enables full traceability, ensuring that every update is documented with timestamps and metadata.
- **Comparison Tools**: Tools that allow comparing inventory versions, providing insights into inventory trends and discrepancies.

## **How It Works**

1. **Store Inventory in S3**: Inventory records are stored in an S3 bucket with versioning enabled.
2. **Track Changes Automatically**: Each inventory update triggers the creation of a new version, ensuring an accurate and accessible version history.
3. **Version Management Interface**: A user-friendly interface allows logistics managers to compare versions and analyze inventory changes.

## **Implementation Steps**

### **Step 1: Install Dependencies**

Clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/inventory-version-control.git
cd inventory-version-control
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **Step 2: Enable S3 Versioning**

Run the `enable_versioning.py` script to enable versioning on your S3 bucket for inventory data storage.

```bash
python enable_versioning.py
```

### **Step 3: Upload Inventory Records**

To upload new inventory data and create a version, use the `upload_inventory.py` script. This will store the updated inventory and generate a versioned record.

```bash
python upload_inventory.py
```

### **Step 4: List and Compare Versions**

To list and compare different inventory versions, use the `list_inventory_versions.py` script.

```bash
python list_inventory_versions.py
```

### **Step 5: Rollback Inventory Records**

If needed, you can revert to a previous inventory version by using the `rollback_inventory.py` script.

```bash
python rollback_inventory.py
```

## **Versioning Pipeline Development**

The versioning pipeline will ensure seamless integration and consistent management of inventory data:

1. **Automate Version Tracking**: Every inventory change will be automatically uploaded and versioned in S3.
2. **Track Metadata**: Metadata such as timestamps and update types will be automatically stored with each version.
3. **Rollback Capability**: Users will be able to roll back to any previous inventory state using an easy-to-use interface.
4. **Collaborating with Praveen**: For further pipeline development and integrations, please connect with Praveen to align on technical requirements and system design.

## **Further Improvements**
- **Integration with Real-Time Inventory Systems**: Automate versioning with real-time inventory updates.
- **AI-Based Forecasting**: Implement AI-based forecasting for inventory restocking, using historical data and trends.
- **Cross-Platform Integration**: Extend versioning to include warehouse management systems and mobile platforms for broader accessibility.
